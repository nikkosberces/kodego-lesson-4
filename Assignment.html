        <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
        <p>First, we nned to learn some basic HTML.</p>

        <h2>Headings</h2>
        <P>
            Headings define the outline of your site. There are six 
            level of headings.
        </P>

        <h2>List</h2>
        <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Add a "ul" element (it stand for unordered list)</li>
            <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
            <li>the don't need to be in any particular order</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
            <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
            <li>Also note how the numbers increment ont their own</li>
            <li>
                You should be noticing things in this precise order, because
                this is an ordered list
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
        <p>
            <em>Sometimes,</em>you need to draw attention to particular
            word or phrase.
        </p>

        <p>
            Other times, your need to <strong>strongly</strong>
            emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <em><strong>And sometimes your need to shout!</strong></em>
        </p>

        <h2>Emty Elements</h2>
        <p>
            Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting
